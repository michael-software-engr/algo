# Algorithms

This will create a binary search tree, create a Graphviz (dot) file representing the tree, then render that file to a PNG file.

# Requirements

You need to install Graphviz and its dev package. On Ubuntu, the package names are `graphviz` and `graphviz-dev`. I'm using `xviewer` to render the PNG file. If you're using a different program, you'll have to edit `binary_tree/utils/render.sh`.
